This guide walks you through the process of creating an application that accesses document-based data through a link:/guides/gs/rest-hateoas[hypermedia-based] link:/understanding/REST[RESTful front end].

== What you'll build

You'll build a Spring application that let's you create and retrieve `Person` objects stored in a http://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] link:/understanding/NoSQL[NoSQL] database using Spring Data REST. Spring Data REST takes the features of http://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas[Spring HATEOAS] and http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-mongodb[Spring Data MongoDB] and combines them together automatically.

NOTE: Spring Data REST also supports link:/guides/gs/accessing-data-rest[Spring Data JPA], link:/guides/gs/accessing-gemfire-data-rest[Spring Data Gemfire] and link:/guides/gs/accessing-neo4j-data-rest[Spring Data Neo4j] as backend data stores, but those are not part of this guide.

== What you'll need

[[initial]]
== Install and launch MongoDB

For this guide to work, you must stand up a local MongoDB server.

On a Mac OS X machine with homebrew, just do this:

```
brew install mongodb
```

More installation options are found at http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/.

After installing it, you need to launch the mongo daemon.

```
$ mongod
all output going to: /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log
```

The MongoDB client that is also installed can be started from another terminal window by typing `mongo`.

== Create a domain object

Create a new domain object to present a person.

`src/main/java/hello/Person.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Person.java[]
----

The `Person` has a first name and a last name. There is also an id object that is configured to be automatically generated so you don't have to deal with that.

== Create a Person repository

Next you need to create a simple repository.

`src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java[]
----

This repository is an interface and will allow you to perform various operations involving `Person` objects. It gets these operations by extending `MongoRepository`, which in turn extends the http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/{spring_data_commons}/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html[PagingAndSortingRepository] interface defined in Spring Data Commons.

At runtime, Spring Data REST will create an implementation of this interface automatically. Then it will use the http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/{spring_data_rest}/api/org/springframework/data/rest/core/annotation/RepositoryRestResource.html[@RepositoryRestResource] annotation to direct Spring MVC to create RESTful endpoints at `/people`.

NOTE: `@RepositoryRestResource` is not required for a repository to be exported. It is only used to change the export details, such as using `/people` instead of the default value of `/persons`.

Here you have also defined a custom query to retrieve a list of `Person` objects based on the lastName. You'll see how to invoke it further down in this guide.

NOTE: Spring Boot by default attempts to connect to a locally hosted instance of MongoDB. Read the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-mongodb[reference docs] for details on pointing your app to an instance of MongoDB hosted elsewhere.

== Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. Along the way, you use Spring's support for embedding the link:/understanding/Tomcat[Tomcat] servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.


`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/spring-boot-application.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_subhead.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.


== Test the application

Now that the application is running, you can test it. You can use any REST client you wish. The following examples use the *nix tool `curl`.

First you want to see the top level service.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080
{
  "_links" : {
    "people" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  }
}
```

Here you get a first glimpse of what this server has to offer. There is a **people** link located at http://localhost:8080/people. It has some options such as `?page`, `?size`, and `?sort`.

NOTE: Spring Data REST uses the http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL format] for JSON output. It is flexible and offers a convenient way to supply links adjacent to the data that is served.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    },
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/search"
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 0,
    "totalPages" : 0,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

There are currently no elements and hence no pages. Time to create a new `Person`!

NOTE: If you run this guide multiple times, there may be left over data. Refer to the http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongo-shell/[MongoDB shell quick reference] to find commands to find and drop your database if you need a fresh start.

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{  \"firstName\" : \"Frodo\",  \"lastName\" : \"Baggins\" }" http://localhost:8080/people
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Location: http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229
Content-Length: 0
Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2014 15:08:46 GMT
```

- `-i` ensures you can see the response message including the headers. The URI of the newly created `Person` is shown
- `-X POST` signals this a `POST` used to create a new entry
- `-H "Content-Type:application/json"` sets the content type so the application knows the payload contains a JSON object
- `-d '{  "firstName" : "Frodo",  "lastName" : "Baggins" }'` is the data being sent

NOTE: Notice how the previous `POST` operation includes a `Location` header. This contains the URI of the newly created resource. Spring Data REST also has two methods on `RepositoryRestConfiguration.setReturnBodyOnCreate(…)` and `setReturnBodyOnUpdate(…)` which you can use to configure the framework to immediately return the representation of the resource just created/updated.

From this you can query for all people:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    },
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/search"
    }
  },
  "_embedded" : {
    "persons" : [ {
      "firstName" : "Frodo",
      "lastName" : "Baggins",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 1,
    "totalPages" : 1,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

The **persons** object contains a list with Frodo. Notice how it includes a **self** link. Spring Data REST also uses http://www.atteo.org/2011/12/12/Evo-Inflector.html[Evo Inflector] to pluralize the name of the entity for groupings.

You can query directly for the individual record:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229
{
  "firstName" : "Frodo",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229"
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: This might appear to be purely web based, but behind the scenes, it is talking to the MongoDB database you started.

In this guide, there is only one domain object. With a more complex system where domain objects are related to each other, Spring Data REST will render additional links to help navigate to connected records.

Find all the custom queries:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/search
{
  "_links" : {
    "findByLastName" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/search/findByLastName{?name}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  }
}
```

You can see the URL for the query including the HTTP query parameter `name`. If you'll notice, this matches the `@Param("name")` annotation embedded in the interface.

To use the `findByLastName` query, do this:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/search/findByLastName?name=Baggins
{
  "_embedded" : {
    "persons" : [ {
      "firstName" : "Frodo",
      "lastName" : "Baggins",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229"
        }
      }
    } ]
  }
}
```

Because you defined it to return `List<Person>` in the code, it will return all of the results. If you had defined it only return `Person`, it will pick one of the Person objects to return. Since this can be unpredictable, you probably don't want to do that for queries that can return multiple entries.

You can also issue `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` REST calls to either replace, update, or delete existing records.

```
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{ \"firstName\": \"Bilbo\", \"lastName\": \"Baggins\" }" http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229
{
  "firstName" : "Bilbo",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229"
    }
  }
}
```

```
$ curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{ \"firstName\": \"Bilbo Jr.\" }" http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229
{
  "firstName" : "Bilbo Jr.",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229"
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: `PUT` replaces an entire record. Fields not supplied will be replaced with `null`. `PATCH` can be used to update a subset of items.

You can delete records:

```
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/people/53149b8e3004990b1af9f229
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    },
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/search"
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 0,
    "totalPages" : 0,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

A very convenient aspect of this link:/understanding/HATEOAS[hypermedia-driven interface] is how you can discover all the RESTful endpoints using curl (or whatever REST client you are using). There is no need to exchange a formal contract or interface document with your customers.

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed an application with a link:/guides/gs/rest-hateoas[hypermedia-based] link:/understanding/REST[RESTful] front end and a MongoDB-based back end.
